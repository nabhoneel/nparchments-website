It&#8217;s black and white, lacks networking, and I am facing a problem to link it to my hardware (printers and stuff). However, I downloaded a few vintage games. As it turns out, in those days *.dsk files would run on the Mac. These &#8216;disk&#8217; files stored a collection of softwares. Even in those days, the games were pretty advanced. The refresh rate was much lower, but that&#8217;s obvious.</span><br />\n<span style=\"font-family:Verdana, sans-serif;\">Here&#8217;s something I found interesting. A few of my friends and myself included have made a few simple games in Java (although they made games that were much more advanced than mine). Even though I tried to eliminate the screen from flickering using a buffer technique my friend had suggested, the fps wasn&#8217;t enough. In those days, these problems were faced! ðŸ˜€ I was playing the classic brick breaking game, and there I saw the flash.</span><br />\n<span style=\"font-family:Verdana, sans-serif;\">It was really amazing to see the OS work. It even had a basic version of Windows Paint (the original mac version from which Windows got the idea, of course). All in all, I&#8217;m pretty excited to be using an OS from 1984.</span><br />\n<span style=\"font-family:Verdana, sans-serif;\"><br />\n</span>Here&#8217;s a screenshot:</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_668\" style=\"width: 512px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://nabhoneelparchments.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/apple-macintosh-1984.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-668\" src=\"https://nabhoneelparchments.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/apple-macintosh-1984.jpg\" alt=\"Apple Macintosh OS  - 1984 \" width=\"512\" height=\"344\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Apple Macintosh OS<br />&#8211; 1984</figcaption></figure>\n</div>\n","date":"2014-03-21T05:06:00.000Z","slug":"mac-1-0","excerpt":"<p>It was created in 1984.
