This is my first exposure to the world. Although I maintained a blog in Blog.com, I didn&#8217;t really keep posting to it for long&#8230;for 3 or 4 days at maximum.

I am a student&#8230;studying in 11th standard. I live in Salt Lake, West Bengal, India. I am pursuing my studies in science(pure+computer and English). This is my introduction to what I study. Now about my hobbies, passions, and my &#8216;likings&#8217;.Â </span></p>\n<p style=\"font-size:medium;font-weight:normal;text-align:justify;\">First of all, what you must know that I am a computer freak. I like gaming, programming(especially), and surfing the net for various things(social networking, etc.).</p>\n<p style=\"font-size:medium;font-weight:normal;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;\">Next, you must know that I am not a pure computer freak&#8230; ðŸ˜› I like music very much(contemporary classical, to be exact). I used to sing, but now I play the piano. I love to listen to various musical compositions by Yanni on my e-book reader. I don&#8217;t play with a group or something. I don&#8217;t even do stage performances, although I have played once(I&#8217;ll go to that later). That&#8217;s it (about music).</span></p>\n<p style=\"font-size:medium;font-weight:normal;text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;\">I also like to make handicrafts. I used to paint earlier(I continued it till class 8 and plan to resume it after I pass my high school). But now I still do my handicrafts. ðŸ˜€</span></p>\n<p style=\"font-size:medium;font-weight:normal;text-align:justify;\">That&#8217;s more or less all about myself. Lastly, what I want to tell you is that I love to go to seasides and mountain regions, and I love adventures and trekking trips! Right now, I&#8217;ll go to have my dinner, later on I&#8217;ll see what I can tell you people! Bye!</p>\n","date":"2012-07-03T17:31:00.000Z","slug":"introduction","fimg_url":false,"excerpt":"<p>This is a type of the common &#8216;HelloWorld&#8217; program we do in almost all languages (in computer), when we are first introduced to them.
