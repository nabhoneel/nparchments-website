It is a non-profit organization, which was founded in 1988.<!--more--></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">NASSCOM is a global trade body with over 1500 member companies. NASSCOM&#8217;s vision is</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">To help the IT and IT enabled products and services industry in India to be a trustworthy, respected, innovative and society friendly industry in the world.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 style=\"text-align:justify;\">What is a start-up?</h2>\n<blockquote><p>It is an organization formed to search for a repeatable and scalable business model.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The above definition was given by Steve Blank and Bob Dorf.<br />\nI believe a start up is that element which, with the right guidance and decisions, moves on to become a successful organization or a company.</p>\n<blockquote><p>How does a start-up &#8216;<em>start</em>&#8216;?</p></blockquote>\n<p>Say college mates sit together to discuss an idea. They see potential in themselves <strong>and </strong>in their idea. They start to work. They take up challenges, do freelance work, conduct workshops, and with time, they develop something that makes them stand out from the rest of the crowd.<br />\nAn elder brother often narrates to me about his experiences while working with start-ups.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Working in start-ups has been the best experience so far, where you are <em>not told exactly what to do.</em> It’s like a family.</p></blockquote>\n<h2>The NASSCOM Product Conclave (NPC)</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">The NASSCOM Product Conclave (NPC) is an annual gathering of product companies and associated services entrepreneurs, tech start-ups, vice chancellors, academicians, angel investors, CIOs and analysts.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Entrepreneurs I have talked to, people who have worked with start ups, people who <em>are </em>a part of a start-up &#8211; have always talked highly about NPCs.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Previously, I have never attended an NPC. This will be my first time. However, I have heard about the 2014 NPC, from Anirban da.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">During last year&#8217;s NASSCOM&#8217;s product conclave, Dr. Amit Mitra (Honourable Minister of IT, Finance and Industries, Government of West Bengal) had announced his help to establish NASSCOM 10000 startup warehouse in Kolkata, only second to Bangalore. Within a couple of months it was established in Webel Building in Salt Lake Sector 5, mentoring a few of the most interesting start ups in the region.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">This is truly commendable.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">This year, the NPC (Kolkata) website has enlisted the following speakers:</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_1264\" style=\"width: 660px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-1264\" src=\"https://nabhoneelparchments.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/npc-2015-speakers.png?w=660\" alt=\"NPC 2015 Speakers\" width=\"660\" height=\"562\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">NPC 2015 Speakers</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">After coming to know about this year&#8217;s NPC, I wanted to know about the speakers, at least some of them.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><strong>Now I <em>am</em> willing to go to the Kolkata NPC!</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Being a student of computer science, it will be a <em>tremendous </em>opportunity to learn from people like Pallav Nadhani, Ravi Trivedi, Kunal Shah, and many others!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">I Googled FusionCharts after coming to know about Mr. Nadhani.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><em>He developed his own spreadsheet software after being dissatisfied with Microsoft Excel&#8217;s charting capabilities at the age of 16!</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">From the point of view of a Computer Science student, I am <em>eagerly </em>waiting to hear from such individuals!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">The Kolkata NPC 2015 website says that the audience can expect to obtain the following from this year&#8217;s conclave:</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"text-align:justify;\">Get insights for Market Access, Global connect with platform players</li>\n<li style=\"text-align:justify;\">Meet CIOs, connect and pitch to various sectors for business</li>\n<li style=\"text-align:justify;\">Experience Next Big things in Technology</li>\n<li style=\"text-align:justify;\">Engaging, Impactful workshops</li>\n<li style=\"text-align:justify;\">Meet Peers and Influencers</li>\n<li style=\"text-align:justify;\">Create Go to Market strategies</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">This year, there shall be separate sections where manufacturing, financial services, retails, healthcare companies could come and interact with IT leaders of the region!

However, Google is always there to help me.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Why would you want to attend this event?</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">From the discussions I have had the privilege to be a part of, I have learnt: <em>Kolkata has a rich pool of talent.</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">However, start-ups often fail to grow owing to the lack of proper guidance. The Conclave will surely provide three elements:</p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"text-align:justify;\"><strong>Knowledge:</strong> How to gain stability and transform a start-up into a successful company/organization.</li>\n<li style=\"text-align:justify;\"><strong>Exposure: </strong>Obtaining the chance to interact with renowned individuals, who have already struggled and made reached a level of excellence; increasing one&#8217;s circle, i.e. meet people who may be like minded.<br />\nPeople will be able to get connected to renowned CEOs and CXOs, who have built their dreams and have received recognition globally!</li>\n<li style=\"text-align:justify;\"><strong>Opportunities: </strong>If one has a product idea, this is the best place to showcase, meet the proper people, and maybe, get funded!</li>\n</ol>\n<hr />\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">I am excited to attend this year&#8217;s Conclave.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">If you are an entrepreneur, a part of a start-up, a student, and you wish to earn knowledge and exposure, <b>the conclave is for you! </b>In Kolkata, it will be held at <a href=\"http://kolkata.regency.hyatt.com/en/hotel/home.html?src=agn_phd_hr_lclb_gplaces_kolka\">The Hyatt Regency</a>, on the <strong>3rd of July. </strong>You can obtain <a href=\"https://www.google.co.in/maps/place/Hyatt+Regency+Kolkata/@22.570458,88.405099,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x3a0275d69f55ee75:0x4e40641064094dc7?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">the directions</a> from Google Maps.
