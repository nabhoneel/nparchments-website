The end of my semester examinations was followed by a lot of events, the first being The Edutainment Show.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">What is the Edutainment Show?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">The Edutainment Show isÂ Indiaâ€™s first and only education fair focused on media, communication &amp; design.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">This year, Kolkata Bloggers was one of the 14 official partners of the show! On the first day, there were 13 panel discussions, among which, one was <em>DigitalSpeak: Blogging as a new marketing tool.Â </em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><a href=\"https://www.anirbansaha.com\" target=\"_blank\">Anirban</a>Â da, the founder of Kolkata Bloggers and an eminent photo-blogger, <a href=\"https://www.presentedbyp.com\" target=\"_blank\">Poorna</a>Â di, one of the most celebrated food bloggers in the nation, and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/abhishek.chamaria\" target=\"_blank\">Mr. Abhishek Chamaria</a>, an entrepreneur and operations chief of Brainwave were the three speakers. The session was moderated by <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/dasaninda?fref=ts\" target=\"_blank\">Mr. Aninda Das</a>,Â the communications chief of Infinity Group.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">It was surprisingly compact,Â because a lot of information was delivered by the speakers that day and the session lasted for 45 minutes only! <a href=\"http://www.kolkatabloggers.com/the-edutainment-show/\" target=\"_blank\">Here&#8217;s</a> a detailed blog post that covers the entire session.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_1232\" style=\"width: 660px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://nabhoneelparchments.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/4.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-1232 size-large\" src=\"https://nabhoneelparchments.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/4.jpg?w=660\" alt=\"Panel Discussion\" width=\"660\" height=\"440\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">From L to R: Anirban Saha, Mr. Abhishek Chamaria, Miss Porrna Banerjee, Mr. Aninda Das | Photograph by Souranil De</figcaption></figure>\n<hr />\n<p id=\"shantiniketan\" style=\"text-align:justify;\">By now, you probably know that Shantiniketan is our second home. Whenever we get an opportunity, we plan a small trip, and spend two or three days there. We relaxed there from 12<sup>th</sup> &#8211; 14<sup>th</sup> June. Here are a few photographs from the first two days:</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_1214\" style=\"width: 660px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://nabhoneelparchments.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/first-three-1-of-3.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-1214 size-large\" src=\"https://nabhoneelparchments.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/first-three-1-of-3.jpg?w=660\" alt=\"Toto\" width=\"660\" height=\"431\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Travelling in a toto!</figcaption></figure><br />\n<figure id=\"attachment_1205\" style=\"width: 660px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://nabhoneelparchments.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/house-1-of-2.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-1205 size-large\" src=\"https://nabhoneelparchments.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/house-1-of-2.jpg?w=660\" alt=\"The house and its proud owner! :D\" width=\"660\" height=\"551\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">The house and its proud owner! ðŸ™‚</figcaption></figure><br />\n<a href=\"https://nabhoneelparchments.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/first-three-2-of-3.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1215 size-large\" src=\"https://nabhoneelparchments.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/first-three-2-of-3.jpg?w=660\" alt=\"First three (2 of 3)\" width=\"660\" height=\"371\" /></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Gunja is always the subject of my experiments, and she always complies (after an initial fuss).</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://nabhoneelparchments.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/first-three-3-of-3.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1204 size-large\" src=\"https://nabhoneelparchments.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/first-three-3-of-3.jpg?w=660\" alt=\"Gunja\" width=\"660\" height=\"412\" /></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">The last day was splendid!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">I bicycled as usual, and went into one of the roads that leads to a village.

The rains had set in a few days back. However, we didn&#8217;t experience torrential rainfall in Shantiniketan. We came to know from Google Now that the clouds had already gifted Kolkata with heavy rain during our stay at <em>Amaar Bari</em>. As we movedÂ towards the Durgapur Expressway, dark clouds started descending in the adjacent areas (that were in sight). The green fields became dark. From our distance, it looked a wee bit like a tornado.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><a href=\"https://nabhoneelparchments.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/road-6-of-6.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1223 size-large\" src=\"https://nabhoneelparchments.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/road-6-of-6.jpg?w=660\" alt=\"Road (6 of 6)\" width=\"660\" height=\"371\" /></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Finally, when the rainfall started (and yes, this time it was torrential rainfall), the road became (almost) invisible. There was a strong breeze and coupled with that, since we were moving forward, the rain drops looked like arrow heads, which were crashing on the windshield! Baba drove on with great attention and expertise,Â and got us out onto the expressway within an hour. He later told usÂ that driving in that weather was one of the toughest things he had done!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">That day, the clouds had transformed the sceneryÂ <span style=\"line-height:1.7;\">(I brightened the images a bit to make them visible).</span></p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_1219\" style=\"width: 660px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://nabhoneelparchments.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/road-1-of-6.jpg\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-1219\" src=\"https://nabhoneelparchments.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/road-1-of-6.jpg?w=660\" alt=\"It's green.

We live on the top floor and above our floor is the rooftop. The staircase ends there (obviously), and there is a small room that contains not only the entrance to the rooftop, but miscellaneous items like a big trunk, chairs, etc. Here&#8217;s a photograph that will give you an idea of the &#8216;room&#8217;:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><a href=\"https://nabhoneelparchments.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/img_0630.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1236\" src=\"https://nabhoneelparchments.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/img_0630-e1434529418572.jpg?w=660\" alt=\"IMG_0630\" width=\"660\" height=\"372\" /></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">When I climbed up on the roof of this &#8216;room&#8217; a few days back, the sight was marvelous! The view from our rooftop is really good, but it gets obstructed by several buildings, tanks, etc. From the top, almost all the obstructions disappeared!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Along with this, there was finally someÂ <em>dramaÂ </em>in the sky (as one of my friends would say), after it stopped raining. I went up with my tripod, and was finally able to take an unobstructed panorama!</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_1237\" style=\"width: 660px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://nabhoneelparchments.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/sky-drama-started-2.jpg\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-1237\" src=\"https://nabhoneelparchments.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/sky-drama-started-2-e1434529828876.jpg?w=660\" alt=\"The sky was actually like that towards 6:30 PM!\" width=\"660\" height=\"245\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">The sky was actually like this towards 6:30 PM!
