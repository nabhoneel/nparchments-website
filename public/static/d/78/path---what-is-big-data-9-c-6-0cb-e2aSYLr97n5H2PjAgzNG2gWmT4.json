From the moment you opened a Google account, or a Facebook account, or even opened the  web browser from a computer or a mobile device, you have been alive in the digital world.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Digital information is recorded, constantly.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">However, this data is being obtained from the <em>entire population of the globe. </em>It is unrelated, random, unorganized, and its size is <i>enormous. </i></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">In 2010, Eric Schmidt, Google&#8217;s executive chairman gave us the following statistical information:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Every two days now, we create as much information as we did from the dawn of civilization up until  2003, according to Schmidt.

You can skip over to the next section if you wish to.<br />\nBig Data has three dimensions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><em><strong>Volume: </strong></em>This is the fundamental attribute of Big Data. <em>Numerous </em>devices feed data into numerous servers. For example, 12 TB of Tweeter information needs to be processed everyday, while Facebook digests 500 TB of data!</li>\n<li><em><strong>Velocity: </strong></em>Data becomes obsolete extremely quickly, and <em>large </em>amounts need to be processed in real time. For example, clickstreams capture user behavior at <em>millions of events per second</em>!</li>\n<li><em><strong>Variety: </strong></em>This is what is listed in the previous section. There is structured data and there is unstructured data. Unstructured data includes text, audio, video, sensor data, geospatial data, logs, and everything else! To predict someone&#8217;s future actions, both types of data need to be analysed together.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><figure style=\"width: 394px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://community.spiceworks.com/topic/404666-big-data-big-confusion-hint-the-key-is-open-data-services\"><img src=\"http://blog.gogrid.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Big-Data-3Vs.png\" alt=\"3 V's of Big Data\" width=\"394\" height=\"316\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Obtained from community.spiceworks.com</figcaption></figure></p>\n<h3>Requirements of Big Data processing</h3>\n<p>The term &#8216;<i>Big Data</i>&#8216; is ambiguous. Consider the decade 1990-2000. Any data that could not be handled with MS-Excel required Unix workstations. Nowadays, data that cannot be placed within a relational database, and analyzed with a statistics package on a desktop, requires parallel software running on <em>numerous </em>servers.<br />\nHence, <em>&#8216;</em><em>Big&#8217; </em>is a term that refers to data size which forces us to look beyond the easily available resources.<br />\nConsidering &#8216;our&#8217; time, we need resources like DRAM, leverage flash memory, parallel processing (high-bandwidth, low-latency interconnects between processors, memory and flash technologies), and making logical copies of data.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3>Applications of Big Data</h3>\n<p>First, let me tell you about some past applications of Big Data:<br />\nBJP won the Indian General Election (of 2014.) Big Data analysis helped.<br />\nBarack Obama got re-elected in 2014. Big Data played a <em>big</em> role.<br />\nFamiliar with Netflix? Traffic patterns help improve the reliability of video streaming, and its recommendation engine works with the help of Hadoop data processing platform.<br />\n<em>Weather predictions </em>can be made with Big Data. WeatherSignal is an app that works by re-purposing the sensors in Android devices to map atmospheric readings.<br />\nThe Large Hadron Collider <em>requires </em>Big Data analysis.<br />\n<em><strong>Internet of Things</strong></em><br />\nBig Data analysis is the basis of artificial intelligence. Currently, it can be used to find out patterns in an individual&#8217;s activities.<br />\nRemember &#8216;<em>The Jetsons</em>&#8216;?<br />\nThere&#8217;s one element of that TV series that I need you to remember: <strong>the automated home.</strong><br />\n<figure id=\"attachment_1319\" style=\"width: 660px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-1319\" src=\"https://nabhoneelparchments.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/what-you-can-learn-from-the-jetsons-about-home-automation-image-1.jpg?w=660\" alt=\"Automated Home Model\" width=\"660\" height=\"371\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Automated Home Model</figcaption></figure><br />\nYou wake up with your alarm. A conveyor belt takes you to your shower, which turns on automatically. As it turns off, the coffee pot and the toaster do their job. Then you go to your car (which is cleaned), you turn on the ignition, and leave for office. As you start your car, the house gets locked, and all unnecessary electrical appliances are turned off.<br />\n<a href=\"http://cm-designs.com/site/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/CM-Designs.com-Jetsons-blog-5.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"http://cm-designs.com/site/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/CM-Designs.com-Jetsons-blog-5.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"457\" /></a><br />\nBasically, the household appliances communicate with each other.<br />\nSounds futuristic? <em>Internet of things (IoT) </em>can turn this into reality.</p>\n<blockquote><p>What is IoT?</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<ol>\n<li class=\"mod\">\n<div class=\"_oDd\">\n<span class=\"_Tgc\"><span class=\"_Tgc\">The <b>Internet of Things</b> (IoT) is a scenario in which objects, animals or people are provided with unique identifiers and the ability to transfer data over a network without requiring human-to-human or human-to-computer interaction.</span></span>(from Whatis.com)\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"mod\">The Internet of Things allows objects to be sensed and controlled remotely across existing network infrastructure(from Wikipedia)</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>IoT needs data to analyze human patterns. Big Data analysis provides the data.<br />\nIoT and Big Data analysis work together. It&#8217;s the union of people, data, appliances, and predictive (intelligent) algorithms.</p>\n<hr />\nThe Data Science Foundation and NASSCOM are going to organize the Second International Data Science Summit, on the 28<sup>th</sup> of August in Kolkata.<br />\nBig Data is a growing buzzword.
