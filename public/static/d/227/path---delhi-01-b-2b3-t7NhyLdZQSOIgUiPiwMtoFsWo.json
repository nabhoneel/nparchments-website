After 2002 (when I was seven years old), we have never stayed in Delhi for more than a few hours. Before planning this trip, my parents had some things in mind.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Duda always wanted to travel in the Rajdhani express (and it hadn&#8217;t happened for one reason or the other). Gunja&#8217;sÂ interest in the Mughal architecture had piqued after studying about the era (as a part of the history course).</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Hence, Delhi and Agra were chosen.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><!--more--></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The train journey was fun. There was a slight delay due to the derailment of a train near Delhi, which caused our train to stop at a station called KulwaÂ for some time.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_1624\" style=\"width: 1920px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1624\" src=\"https://nabhoneelparchments.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/31st-october-4-of-191.jpg\" alt=\"Kulwa Stop\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1062\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">They were waiting for the signal | At Kulwa Station</figcaption></figure>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Delhi is yet another metropolitan city, with wider roads and heavier traffic than Kolkata.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">After a certain age, a long trip started to mean <em>mountains</em> to me. I wasn&#8217;t so excited about this trip. However, the thought of visiting the heritage sites of India and learning about them was fascinating.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Day One</h2>\n<figure id=\"attachment_1628\" style=\"width: 1920px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1628\" src=\"https://nabhoneelparchments.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/31st-october-11-of-19.jpg\" alt=\"31st October (11 of 19).jpg\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Daughter and The Mother</figcaption></figure>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We reached Delhi at 1:30 PM.
