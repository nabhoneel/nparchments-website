Usually, the <em>mighty effect</em> can be brought by combining several pictures, each picture containing one or moreÂ streaks.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">I couldn&#8217;t do that for several reasons, however I did get a bit lucky.</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_1189\" style=\"width: 660px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-1189 size-large\" src=\"https://nabhoneelparchments.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/flash-1-of-2-b-w.jpg?w=660\" alt=\"lightning flash\" width=\"660\" height=\"371\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>This</strong> is a single photograph</figcaption></figure></p>\n<hr />\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">After my exams ended, the skies did show more clouds, well defined at the time of sunset.</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_1192\" style=\"width: 660px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-1192\" src=\"https://nabhoneelparchments.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/ghostbuilding.jpg?w=660\" alt=\"Natural and man made structures\" width=\"660\" height=\"440\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Natural and man made structures</figcaption></figure><br />\n<figure id=\"attachment_1190\" style=\"width: 660px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-1190\" src=\"https://nabhoneelparchments.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/clouds-2.jpg?w=660\" alt=\"There was a week of high temperature and humidity, and finally, on the 11th of June, God gifted Kolkata with this sky, a storm, and torrential rainfall!\" width=\"660\" height=\"371\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">There was a week of high temperature and humidity, and finally, on the 11th of June, God gifted Kolkata with this sky, a storm, and torrential rainfall!</figcaption></figure></p>\n<hr />\n<h1>Friends</h1>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">They don&#8217;t deserve any special mentioning, because at every instance of time, they make life more valuable.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">At hostel, there are certain people with whom I enjoy spending time most.
