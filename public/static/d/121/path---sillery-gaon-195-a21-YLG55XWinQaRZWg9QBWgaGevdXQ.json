I was back to the mountains within a span of three months, and it didn&#8217;t feel any less refreshing &#8211; the forest, the locality, the furry breeds of dogs, theÂ low temperatures (oh, by the way, this was my first trip to the mountains during winter), and the pointy, elevated lands.<br />\nWhen the sunlight gradually disappeared, only five of us were still on the hike. The rest had returned. Thankfully, we had a loyal friend who kept on leading us forward (although, he did disappear at one point).</p>\n<blockquote><p>Bhai, o toh territory mark korte korte choleche ðŸ˜€</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">&#8211; Prantik</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_5366\" style=\"width: 500px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-5366\" src=\"https://www.nparchments.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Summit-e1486937103627.jpg\" alt=\"Four standing in the forest at Sillery Gaon\" width=\"500\" height=\"464\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Subhasish, Debanna, Prantik and Aditya (L to R) &#8211; at the summit of our tiny hike</figcaption></figure><br />\nWe walked down as carefully as we could.Â Our smartphones&#8217; flashlight-torches were all we needed.<br />\nOn reaching the place where we were staying, we found our teachers and the rest of our friends gradually making a bonfire.

It&#8217;s often a sight-seeing location. This isÂ <strong>exactlyÂ </strong>the reason for which you should stay.<br />\nThe solitude. The silence.<br />\nBeautiful elements. Usually, you have to travel to a far-off place, or a remote, hard-to-reach location to find those while on a trip. But Sillery Gaon, well, it&#8217;s a 4-5 hours drive from Siliguri.</p>\n<div id=\"wp_cd_code\"></div>\n<div style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:-9999px; display:inline;\">\n<p><a href=\"https://nulledhub.net/\">themeforest</a> </p>\n</div>\n","date":"2017-02-13T15:23:18.000Z","slug":"sillery-gaon","_links":{"self":[{"href":"http://localhost:8000/wp-json/wp/v2/posts/5573"}]},"excerpt":"<p>The night sky was like the black chart paper, with stars sprinkled on it.</p>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Nabhoneel's Parchments","subtitle":"All thing photographed and written down"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"8cb9b353-060b-5b39-8055-e06a144fa9ec"}}
