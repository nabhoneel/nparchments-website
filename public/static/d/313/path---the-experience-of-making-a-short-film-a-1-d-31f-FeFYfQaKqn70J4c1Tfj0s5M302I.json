How about movies?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">~Sreyan Mullick Chowdhury.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Sreyan talked me into something I was originally uninterested in. <!--more-->Ever since I have known him, he&#8217;s been enthusiastic. Some people have questioned his abilities.Â But after being his friend for four years, I&#8217;ve understood something. He&#8217;s a person <strong>fullÂ </strong>of potential, andÂ capable of aÂ <strong>lot of things</strong>.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><em>The Anon. Productions</em> happens to be one of his dream projects. It wasÂ <strong>ourÂ </strong>dream project. Now, it&#8217;s transformed into something else. It has expanded. It has more members, who each specialize in different fields. It&#8217;s a working production house. And quite recently, it produced a short film.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">This post is about how we brought into existence a movie based on the theme <strong>&#8216;Then and Now&#8217;.</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Courier New';\">If you want to skip to the short film, click <a href=\"#movie\">here</a>.</span></p>\n<hr />\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">I won&#8217;t narrate in detail about what happened during each day. I&#8217;ll give you a gist.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">The first 3 days were spent on shooting the video. Here are some pictures, from the &#8216;shooting days&#8217; :</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_819\" style=\"width: 660px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-819 size-large\" src=\"https://nabhoneelparchments.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/fixing-camera.jpg?w=660\" alt=\"fixing camera\" width=\"660\" height=\"393\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Shooting the &#8216;black and white portion&#8217; of the film</figcaption></figure><br />\n<figure id=\"attachment_816\" style=\"width: 450px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-816\" src=\"https://nabhoneelparchments.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/crazy-agnij-sreyan.jpg?w=253\" alt=\"crazy agnij sreyan\" width=\"450\" height=\"800\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Sreyan with Agnij [behind the camera]Â <strong>*craziness*</strong></figcaption></figure></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-853\" src=\"https://nabhoneelparchments.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/in-shoot.jpg?w=660\" alt=\"in shoot\" width=\"660\" height=\"495\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">I wasn&#8217;t involved during these days. The last two days (before the submission date) were critical to me.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3 style=\"text-align:justify;\">Day 4 (21<sup>st</sup> of January, 2015):</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">My college ended at 5:00 PM. I went home and set up the condenser microphone, the stand, and connected the microphone to my laptop.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_832\" style=\"width: 500px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-832\" src=\"https://nabhoneelparchments.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/dhanolti-1.jpg?w=450\" alt=\"All ready\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">All ready</figcaption></figure>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">The short film would contain no conversations (among the actors). Narration, foley sounds and music &#8211; these would be contributing to the &#8216;audio&#8217; of the movie. Nilanjan, the co-writer and the co-director would be narrating for the movie. He came to my house at 8 PM. He read the lines to himself again and again to get the proper emotions in his voice. Sreyan and Avishek were editing the video files at Avishek&#8217;s house.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-831 size-large\" src=\"https://nabhoneelparchments.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/screenshot_premier-pro.jpg?w=660\" alt=\"screenshot_premier pro\" width=\"660\" height=\"495\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">We were communicating via Skype.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_808\" style=\"width: 660px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-808\" src=\"https://nabhoneelparchments.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/skype1.jpg?w=660\" alt=\"Sreyan [right] and Avishek\" width=\"660\" height=\"371\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Sreyan [right] and Avishek</figcaption></figure>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><strong>At 12:30 AM, Nilanjan was ready</strong>. I set the microphone to his level. He then narrated. Our work was completedÂ at 3:00 AM. Nilanjan perfected himself within three takes. But there was slight noise in the background, and the sound needed to be crisp. Coupled with that, I&#8217;m not an expert at mastering and editing. I did my best.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-830\" src=\"https://nabhoneelparchments.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/screenshot_audition.jpg?w=660\" alt=\"screenshot_audition\" width=\"660\" height=\"371\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">And the end product, although produced at a late hour, wasn&#8217;t so bad ðŸ™‚</p>\n<hr />\n<h3 style=\"text-align:justify;\">Day 2 [The Final day before submission &#8211; 22<sup>nd</sup> of January, 2015]</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><strong>Video editing had been completed during the previous night by Sreyan and Avishek</strong>. Meanwhile, after completing our work on the narration, I had sent the audio files to them. Sreyan had positioned the narration properly (in the video). What was left was the foley sounds, and the music. Frankly, I was too scared to even think of how to do it. We had absolutelyÂ <strong>noÂ </strong>knowledge on how to make foley sounds.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">After attending college, Sreyan and I boarded a bus and came to my home. We were tired. The previous night, Sreyan had hadÂ <strong>no rest</strong>. I had slept for 3 hours. The tension however, drove the sleep away. We set up the microphone, the laptop, and started our job.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">We noted down the scenes that required folly. And I created a preset on Audition after recording a &#8216;typing foley&#8217;.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_833\" style=\"width: 660px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-833\" src=\"https://nabhoneelparchments.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/dhanolti-2.jpg?w=660\" alt=\"Practicing\" width=\"660\" height=\"440\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Practicing</figcaption></figure>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">We spent an hour deciding how to get the other parts done. Moreover, we would have to wait till everyone was asleep in the house, because <strong>noise was not something we could allow</strong>. Avishek and Nilanjan arrived at 10:00 PM, and the four of us had Chinese food for dinner ðŸ™‚</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><strong>At 12:00 AM, work resumed</strong>. It was <em>amazing</em>! With each passing minute, we discovered newer and better ways to make and record foley sounds! I even tried to pan the microphone with Sreyan&#8217;s footsteps. Several effects were ready by 3:00 AM &#8211; <em>typing, blowing out a candle, walking, letter falling, sitting on an easy-chair, and several others</em>. But, by then, exhaustion was gradually creeping over the two of us. We decided to take a break, and talk for a while&#8230;</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align:justify;\">The Date of Submission</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">The <strong>6:00 AM alarm</strong> on Sreyan&#8217;s cellphone woke the four of us. We had a few hours left before submission. <strong>Mayhem broke out inside our minds</strong>.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Within half an hour, we recorded the remaining foley sounds &#8211; <em>knocking, writing, crumbling</em>, etc. Nilanjan utilized that time to download a track that contained firefly sounds.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">In the next half hour, I edited the foley tracks, and made them ready for use. Here are two foley sound-tracks:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">[soundcloud url=&#8221;https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/191147886?secret_token=s-6r1KM&#8221;] <span style=\"font-family:'Courier New';\">Blowing out a candle [Alternative <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/nabhoneel95/candle-flame-foley/s-6r1KM\">link on SoundCloud</a>]</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">[soundcloud url=&#8221;https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/191148537?secret_token=s-GSUQe&#8221;] <span style=\"font-family:'Courier New';\">Typing [Alternative <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/nabhoneel95/final-typing/s-GSUQe\">link on SoundCloud</a>]</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">What followed that was two and a half hours of video editing by Avishek and Sreyan. Now that I&#8217;m recalling everything, I realize what level of expertise the two possess. Under theÂ <strong>enormousÂ </strong>pressure, they swiftly placedÂ <strong>allÂ </strong>the foley tracks, added aÂ <strong>hugeÂ </strong>number of minor details, added credits, added the intro, and even corrected several portions!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">However, the music was not yet done. At 11:00 AM, Avishek asked me to connect my (musical) keyboard to my laptop, and stated</p>\n<blockquote><p>You have exactly five minutes. Watch the video and play, just play what you think is right, and play without any mistakes.</p></blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">I was not veryÂ satisfied with what I had done. The only thing that was good was the final music &#8211;Â <em>I Giorni</em><em>Â </em>byÂ <em>Ludovico Einaudi.Â </em></p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align:justify;\">The Last Hour</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><strong>I pulled out the UPS</strong>, packed it in a bag (since the laptop battery wasn&#8217;t powerful enough to last for an hour).The four of us got ready. <strong>Nilanjan called a taxi</strong>. I packed in anything we would need. The <strong>video rendering process was initiated</strong>, and the three of us &#8211; Avishek, Nilanjan and myself &#8211; started off for St. Xavier&#8217;s College. We submitted the short film later that day.</p>\n<hr />\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Â We don&#8217;t know the results yet. The judges haven&#8217;t decided. 7 other colleges are competing against us. Our film wasn&#8217;t perfect. However, we all agreed something&#8230;</p>\n<blockquote><p>This wasÂ <strong>the craziestÂ </strong>project we had all taken part in!</p></blockquote>\n<div id=\"movie\" style=\"text-align:justify;\">And, we had given in everything we had in the five days that were available to us.

And frankly, the decision of the judges won&#8217;t matter. We, <strong>The Anon.

They decided to mark our work the best among the 7 short films that had been submitted. We won the competition. I&#8217;ll admit something. The victory didn&#8217;t matter much.
