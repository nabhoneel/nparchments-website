On the 16<sup>th</sup> of January, bloggers from all age groups gathered in the iconic Oxford Book Store, at Park Street, for the award distribution ceremony of the &#8216;Great Indian Blogging Contest&#8217;, and to hear from established bloggers speak about SEO, self branding, monetizing blogs, presenting creative blog posts, and much more.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;padding-left:30px;\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-679\" src=\"https://nabhoneelparchments.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/img_9443-2.jpg?w=1000\" alt=\"IMG_9443-2\" width=\"660\" height=\"440\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">The event was organized with support from <a href=\"http://www.kolkatabloggers.com\">Kolkata Bloggers</a>. <a href=\"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/\">The Times of India</a> (TOI) and <a href=\"http://www.oxfordbookstore.com/dotcom/oxford/\">Oxford Bookstore</a> were partners.

One part of the first floor contains the &#8216;<a href=\"http://www.oxfordbookstore.com/dotcom/oxford/discover/cha_bar/index.htm\">Cha Bar</a>&#8216; &#8211; a small food corner.

He presented us the advantages of blogging with examples from his own life &#8211; how blogging escalated his confidence as a speaker and improved his English as well. He told us how blogging provides a competitive advantage to everyone, especially to aspiring authors.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">When you have your work discoverable online, you open an entire range of opportunities for yourself</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_682\" style=\"width: 660px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-682 size-large\" src=\"https://nabhoneelparchments.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/img_9474-1.jpg?w=660\" alt=\"IMG_9474-1\" width=\"660\" height=\"436\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Anirban Saha</figcaption></figure><br />\nThe world now lives and breathes online. Two terms were introduced &#8211; <strong>branding </strong>and <strong>promotion</strong>. Suppose you are going to introduce yourself to someone for the first time. Basically, the latter does the job beforehand. He &#8216;Googles&#8217; you. He researches you. Now consider this:</p>\n<blockquote><p>What if you can not impress him? He might not meet you and you might lose an opportunity.<br />\nYour visibility and interactions online, creates a small brand for yourself.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Before leaving the dias, he gave us examples of how some bloggers made an offline presence with their content &#8211; The Great Bong, Arnab Ray, Anuradha Goyal, Suchi Singh Kalra.</p>\n<div id=\"Suman\">\nFollowing him, <a href=\"http://yourstory.com/2011/06/suman-chakraborty-roman-books-literary-fiction-and-poetry-for-general-trade/\">Suman Chakraborty</a>, CEO and executive editor of <a href=\"http://www.romanbooks.co.in/\">Roman Books</a>, utilized a PowerPoint presentation to give us a brief idea about what publishers look for in writers. Along with that he informed us about a new project they would be undertaking &#8211; Roman Books would be picking out certain blog posts from various interested Indian bloggers and collating them into a book. The idea had stemmed from a senior editor at Roman Books &#8211; who had a blog that addressed letters to various day-to-day elements.<br />\n<figure id=\"attachment_684\" style=\"width: 660px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-684 size-large\" src=\"https://nabhoneelparchments.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/img_9508-1.jpg?w=660\" alt=\"IMG_9508-1\" width=\"660\" height=\"335\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Suman Chakraborty</figcaption></figure><br />\nHe notified us of the various elements Roman Books would be looking for in a blog post, emphasizing on <strong>creativity </strong>and <strong>saleability</strong>, lastly mentioning that only fairly established blogs, with good reviews and comments would be considered for the book.\n</div>\n<div id=\"Sen\">\nShib Nath Sen of <a href=\"https://www.jwt.com/india\">JWT</a>, an advertising agency, followed Mr. Chakraborty, with how to use blogs as a boost to sales and presence. He uses his blog to vent out the pressure from his career.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Blogs must touch the reader&#8217;s heart and everyone needs to develop a style of his own</p></blockquote>\n<p>He gave a few examples of how a distinctive style sets apart companies. Apple simply makes things differently. They have good marketing skills.</p>\n<blockquote><p>We just happen to make great computers &#8211; Apple</p></blockquote>\n<p>He also narrated incidents from his life to explain proper presentation that should be done in blog posts.\n</p></div>\n<div id=\"Aji\">\n<a href=\"http://aji.techshu.com/\">Aji Isaac Mathew</a>, CEO of <a href=\"http://www.techshu.com/\">Techshu</a> was next. His presentation would primarily concern the topic &#8216;<strong>How Easy is SEO?</strong>&#8216;<br />\n<figure id=\"attachment_721\" style=\"width: 660px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-721\" src=\"https://nabhoneelparchments.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/aji.jpg?w=660\" alt=\"Aji Isaac Mathew\" width=\"660\" height=\"435\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Aji Isaac Mathew [Photograph by <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sayanphotography123?ref=ts&amp;fref=ts\">Sayan Biswas</a>]</figcaption></figure></div>\n<div></div>\n<div>\nHe touched some extremely valid points about blogging in general. Each and every blogger should have a target audience. Humans around the world have common interests. A person blogging for a particular reason might provide valid information for another person.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The reason why you are blogging is the reason why others will read it</p></blockquote>\n<p>SEO stands for <strong>S</strong>earch <strong>E</strong>ngine <strong>O</strong>ptimization. Aji introduced a valid point:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\">SEO is a backdated concept. Blogs, nowadays, should target SMO &#8211; <strong>S</strong>earch <strong>M</strong>edia <strong>O</strong>ptimization.</p>\n<p>Earlier, he used various RSS readers, such as Google Reader to get updates from various blogs. Now, the scenario has changed.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Nowadays, you don&#8217;t reach out to blogs. Blogs come to you.</p></blockquote>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\"><strong>Everyone</strong>, around the globe, shares on various social networks. Thus, getting updates from bloggers is no longer something the reader needs to concern himself with.</p>\n<p>Initially, monetizing a blog should not be the blogger&#8217;s goal. He should write for passion. Later, when the blogger starts to get traffic, proper archiving should be done. For many, a blog is a form of catharsis. However, it should be kept in mind, blog posts can have long term effects if done properly. &#8216;The perfect blog post&#8217; is not easy. And no such thing exists. You can only strive to do better.\n</p></div>\n<div id=\"Shilpa\">\nBefore Anirban Saha went up on the dias again, the last speaker Shilpa Srivastava, Social Media Lead of <a href=\"http://www.infobase.co.in/\">Compare Infobase</a>, provided insights on how to promote blogs. She constantly emphasized on leaving behind the &#8216;first person factor&#8217;.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Come out of the &#8216;I&#8217; factor. Your blog should be more popular than you and not the other way around.</p></blockquote>\n<p>A wonderful piece of advice got hard-coded into my mind. Bloggers should initially &#8216;release teasers&#8217; of their upcoming blog post. These teasers should be shared on various social media platforms. She included something she had done herself. Before releasing a post on a recent vintage car rally race, she had posted:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Do you know the difference between &#8216;vintage cars&#8217; and &#8216;classic cars&#8217;?</p></blockquote>\n<p>This was something many were unaware of.<br />\nShe advised that bloggers should maintain a profile on <a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/\">Pinterest</a>, apart from <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com\">Facebook</a>,<a href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/\"> Google+ </a>and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/\">Twitter</a>.\n</div>\n<hr />\n<div id=\"prizes\">\nDuring the event, prizes were handed out to the winners of the &#8216;Great Indian Blogging Contest&#8217;. 70+ valid entries had come from members of the Kolkata Bloggers team itself. The topic announced by TOI had been</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\">&#8216;The Great Indian Chamcha&#8217; &#8211; a humorous take on the culture of sycophancy that runs deep in politics and has slowly become part of our daily lives.</p>\n<p>Actor-author Tisca Chopra gave away the prizes to the top three blogs posts &#8211; Namrata Kumari, Rushati Mukherjee and Sohaiil Mohammed (mentioned according to their ranks). Amartya Talukdar won the award for the most engaging blog.<br />\n<figure id=\"attachment_729\" style=\"width: 660px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-729\" src=\"https://nabhoneelparchments.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/second.jpg?w=660\" alt=\"Rushati Mukherjee\" width=\"660\" height=\"436\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Rushati Mukherjee [Photograph by <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sayanphotography123?ref=ts&amp;fref=ts\">Sayan Biswas</a>]</figcaption></figure><figure id=\"attachment_730\" style=\"width: 660px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-730\" src=\"https://nabhoneelparchments.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/sohaiil.jpg?w=660\" alt=\"Sohaiil Mohammed\" width=\"660\" height=\"436\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Sohaiil Mohammed [Photograph by <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sayanphotography123?ref=ts&amp;fref=ts\">Sayan Biswas</a>]</figcaption></figure><br />\n<figure id=\"attachment_705\" style=\"width: 660px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-705\" src=\"https://nabhoneelparchments.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/img_9497-12.jpg?w=660\" alt=\"Amartya Talukdar - receiving the 'most engaging blog' award\" width=\"660\" height=\"385\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Amartya Talukdar &#8211; receiving the &#8216;most engaging blog&#8217; award</figcaption></figure>\n</div>\n<hr />\nThe event was of-its-own-kind. The points enumerated by Anirban Saha, Aji Isaac Mathew, Shilpa Srivastava and Shib Nath Sen were valuable. I believe these are necessities for <strong>every </strong>blogger, irrespective of where they are living, or which society they come from, or even their age group. This was a big event for Kolkata Bloggers.<br />\nAs a young blogger who has just started to share his work, this was very knowledgeable. Tips about sharing with &#8216;pre-teasers&#8217;, concept of SMO, branding and promotion are certain things I will keep in mind in my future posts. Teasers are something I will certainly use in the future, for example, when I&#8217;m writing about travelling to a certain place.<br />\nI congratulate the winners of the &#8216;Great Indian Blogging Contest&#8217;. From the little snippets Jit Sengupta read out (from their respective posts), I felt that TOI had made proper judgement.<br />\nThe following day, that is one the 17<sup>th</sup> of January, TOI included the bloggers meet:<br />\n<figure id=\"attachment_731\" style=\"width: 660px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-731\" src=\"https://nabhoneelparchments.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/newspaper1.jpg?w=660\" alt=\"Newspaper clipping from TOI [dated 17th of January, 2015]\" width=\"660\" height=\"269\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Newspaper clipping from TOI [dated 17<sup>th</sup> of January, 2015]</figcaption></figure></p>\n<hr />\n<span style=\"font-family:'Courier New';\">All photographs (except for the ones mentioned) were shot by Soupayan Dutta at the event.
