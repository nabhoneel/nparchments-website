That&#8217;s when we first went on a long trip (before that, my memory was more volatile than it is now, so I don&#8217;t remember where we went before that). And that was when we had first visited Agra. But I only have faint memories of Taj Mahal from that trip.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Last year, although I yearned for mountains, Agra was something I was interested in exploring, especially for taking photos of the Taj Mahal from a certain location that my mother had told me about ðŸ™‚</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><!--more--></p>\n<h1 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Day 3: 2nd November, 2015</h1>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We travelled to Agra from Delhi via road.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Agra is an older city.

Places are numbered throughout a heritage site (with numbered boards) and if you type in the number on your device, a pre-recorded voice narrates various facts about that specific place.
