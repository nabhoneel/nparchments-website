I think, in the future, if I do make more ebooks, it will be in Sigil, especially because it puts less load on the computer hardware ðŸ™‚</p>\n</div>\n","date":"2013-03-09T09:53:00.000Z","slug":"creating-ebooks","excerpt":"<p>When I had attempted to gain root access to my Sony Reader, I had damaged it (when I tried to modify a code via adb, after rooting).
