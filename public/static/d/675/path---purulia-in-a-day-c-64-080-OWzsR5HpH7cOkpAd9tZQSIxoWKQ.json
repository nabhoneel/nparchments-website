A few years back I used to think that Purulia is a hill station and like all hill stations, it is cooler than the plain lands.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It was hotter than Shantiniketan and additionally, it was humid! However, the terrain was similar to that of hills. In fact, the compound within which our hotel was situated (a part of the forest reserve of India) was entirely located on a slope. We lodged at a resort in <em>Garpanchakot.</em></p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_3031\" style=\"width: 400px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://www.nparchments.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Slopes-2-of-2.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-3031\" src=\"https://www.nparchments.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Slopes-2-of-2.jpg\" alt=\"Purulia Forest Reserve Hotel\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">This is one of the shortcuts to the bungalow from the dining place</figcaption></figure>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Day One</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We reached Purulia by 2:00 PM, had lunch and headed out towards Muradi dam (after an hour of laziness).</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_3021\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://www.nparchments.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Purulia-Grasslands.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-3021\"><img class=\"wp-image-3021 size-large\" src=\"https://www.nparchments.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Purulia-Grasslands-1024x498.jpg\" alt=\"Purulia Grasslands\" width=\"1024\" height=\"498\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Cows doing their daily work is a common sight at Shantiniketan.

We followed everything the voice inside Google Maps had to say. When the sun&#8217;s rays were no longer illuminating the road for us, and we were still on a road which we couldn&#8217;t identify, I became a wee bit worried. The road was empty. So were the surroundings. It was almost pitch black.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We had no option but to trust <em>Google </em><em>Maps. </em>In spite of the slight anxiousness, there was a thrill and a slight chill in the air. Occasionally, the fragrance of unknown flowers would flow into the car. What accompanied us all the way till the point we reached the main road was the scent of the grassland and the trees.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Everything contributed to making the entire &#8216;journey&#8217; to and from Muradi dam memorable.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Day Two</h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I woke up at 4:50 in the morning.
