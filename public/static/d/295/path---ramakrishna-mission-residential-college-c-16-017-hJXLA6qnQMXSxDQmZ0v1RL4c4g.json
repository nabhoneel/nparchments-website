My life in RKMRC is beautiful! This post will be about RKMRC.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><!--more--></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">I&#8217;m studying computer science. The faculty of this department is fantastic. I had one singular computer science teacher in my school life whom I deeply respected. I never expected to get teachers like her in my college life.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">The three teachers who are professors of the computer science department of RKMRC are the sole reason who make each new day in college exciting.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_638\" style=\"width: 400px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-638\" src=\"https://nabhoneelparchments.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/dsc_0390.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"The department corridor\" width=\"400\" height=\"399\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">The department corridor</figcaption></figure>\n<hr />\n<h4 style=\"text-align:justify;\"> As a resident of <em>Ramakrishnananda</em> Bhavan</h4>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Each room in our hostel buildings has four students residing together. I am <strong>extremely lucky. </strong>I have a fantastic peer group in Narendrapur! Not just my three roommates. We share the same &#8216;wavelength&#8217; &#8211; the students living in the adjacent room, and a few students from rooms adjacent to it. I can be free with them. We talk for hours on end and never tire out. I never present a modified form of myself in front of them.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_611\" style=\"width: 600px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-611\" src=\"https://nabhoneelparchments.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/img_20150109_230215.jpg?w=1000\" alt=\"IMG_20150109_230215\" width=\"600\" height=\"360\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">The occupants of room number 10 in RB</figcaption></figure>\n<pre> RB: Ramakrishnananda Bhavan\n</pre>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_614\" style=\"width: 600px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-614\" src=\"https://nabhoneelparchments.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/dsc_1396.jpg?w=1000\" alt=\"From the 'adjacent rooms'\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">From the &#8216;adjacent rooms&#8217;</figcaption></figure><br />\n<figure id=\"attachment_612\" style=\"width: 600px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-612\" src=\"https://nabhoneelparchments.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/img_20150109_224551.jpg?w=1000\" alt=\"IMG_20150109_224551\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">We often continue our conversations till 3am or 4am.

We had an oath taking day, a month from the day our college commenced &#8211; the &#8216;<em>vidyarthi brata</em>&#8216;.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-615\" src=\"https://nabhoneelparchments.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/10506697_762346623822065_2223405843907914337_o.jpg?w=1000\" alt=\"10506697_762346623822065_2223405843907914337_o\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" /></p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_617\" style=\"width: 600px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-617\" src=\"https://nabhoneelparchments.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/10549997_762348283821899_7697504860081819708_o.jpg?w=1000\" alt=\"10549997_762348283821899_7697504860081819708_o\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Fresh Faces!</figcaption></figure><br />\n<figure id=\"attachment_619\" style=\"width: 600px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-619\" src=\"https://nabhoneelparchments.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/10636745_762348560488538_209087659701945995_o.jpg?w=1000\" alt=\"10636745_762348560488538_209087659701945995_o\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Nearly three hundred of us went to the altar to offer <a href=\"http://babadham.org/bilwapatra.php\"><i>&#8216;bilwapatra&#8217;</i></a> after taking the oath.</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">We hadn&#8217;t expected much initially. However, it was a very peaceful and serene experience. Along with that, delicious food was served during the afternoon 😀</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">The most common question that people ask me is</p>\n<blockquote><p>Toder prayer korte hoy na dhuti pore (Don&#8217;t you have to pray wearing &#8216;<em>dhotis</em>&#8216;)?</p></blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Yes. We have a morning and an evening prayer. But it is not painful or imposing. The evening prayer, especially, has a calming effect after we return from college. The prayers start with a প্রারথনা সঙ্গীত(prayer song). Following that, a student reads out from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Sri_Ramakrishna_Kathamrita\">কথামৃত</a> (Kathamrita) and other similar texts. Finally, we meditate and practice <a href=\"https://www.google.co.in/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=6&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CEcQFjAF&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FPranayama&amp;ei=RG2zVLH4KtOOuASRq4L4AQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNHfZ6SpjK_A1jrZhfizxsWxT11HeA&amp;sig2=SQu0Qewyyguy88MfuB-bDQ&amp;bvm=bv.83339334,d.c2E\">প্রাণায়াম</a> (pranyama). This rejuvenates us.</p>\n<hr />\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">In the month of September, we had our college fest &#8211; &#8216;<em>Uttishthata</em>&#8216;. This was a very unique event, and one I thoroughly enjoyed. Uttishthata comprised of three days &#8211; the first day had &#8216;<em>HaJaBaRaLa</em>&#8216;, the second day, a drama competition among the three <em>Bhavans, </em>and, on the last day, a magic show presented by a student of noted magician P. C. Sorcar.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">&#8216;HaJaBaRaLa&#8217; was a medley of quiz, creating stories, extempore, and more. It consisted of three teams, one from each <em>bhavan.</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">The drama still plays in my head. The concepts transcended our expectations, and everything &#8211; the stories, the scripts, the stagecraft &#8211; had been conceptualized and realized by the students of RKMRC. I was stunned by the three plays!</p>\n<h5 style=\"text-align:justify;\">Gauranga Bhavan&#8217;s play:</h5>\n<figure id=\"attachment_625\" style=\"width: 400px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-625\" src=\"https://nabhoneelparchments.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/gb1.jpg?w=200\" alt=\"আসাময়িক (Untimely)\" width=\"400\" height=\"600\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">অসাময়িক (Untimely)</figcaption></figure>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">About the flow of time</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-624\" src=\"https://nabhoneelparchments.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/gb.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"gb\" width=\"600\" height=\"293\" /></p>\n<h5 style=\"text-align:justify;\">Brahmananda Bhavan&#8217;s play:</h5>\n<figure id=\"attachment_626\" style=\"width: 600px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-626\" src=\"https://nabhoneelparchments.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/bb1.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"কুয়াশা বালক ও তারা (The Boy and The Mist) \" width=\"600\" height=\"396\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">কুয়াশা বালক ও তারা (The Boy, The Mist, and others)</figcaption></figure>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-627\" src=\"https://nabhoneelparchments.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/10712858_699324756823972_9213350444024604702_n.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"10712858_699324756823972_9213350444024604702_n\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" /></p>\n<h5 style=\"text-align:justify;\">Ramakrishnananda Bhavan&#8217;s play:</h5>\n<figure id=\"attachment_623\" style=\"width: 600px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-623\" src=\"https://nabhoneelparchments.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/rb3.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"ইচ্ছামৃত্যু (Wishful Death)\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">ইচ্ছামৃত্যু (Wishful Death)</figcaption></figure>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-622\" src=\"https://nabhoneelparchments.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/rb2.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"rb2\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-621\" src=\"https://nabhoneelparchments.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/rb1.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"rb1\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">The hangover of these three magnificent plays lasted for days.

Tranquility and natural beauty encompasses the whole 180 acre campus. The numerous facilities &#8211; the huge fields, a full size swimming pool, a central library with almost 60,000 books and numerous journals, two gymnasiums, indoor games &#8211; always keep us engaged. Life never gets boring in Ramakrishna Mission, Narendrapur. Personally, the beauty is enough to keep me inside the campus for long periods of time.</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_630\" style=\"width: 400px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-630\" src=\"https://nabhoneelparchments.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/2014-12-03-15-58-20.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"The bypass road from the hostel buildings to our college\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">The bypass road from the hostel buildings to our college</figcaption></figure><br />\n<figure id=\"attachment_633\" style=\"width: 600px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-633\" src=\"https://nabhoneelparchments.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/dsc_1405.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"Ramakrishna Mission Residential College\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Ramakrishna Mission Residential College</figcaption></figure><br />\n<figure id=\"attachment_632\" style=\"width: 600px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-632\" src=\"https://nabhoneelparchments.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/dsc_1403.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"The main gate of the college building\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">The main gate of the college building</figcaption></figure><br />\n<figure id=\"attachment_634\" style=\"width: 600px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-634\" src=\"https://nabhoneelparchments.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/dsc_1389.jpg?w=300\" alt=\"The second floor corridor at 7:30 am  \" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">The second floor corridor at 7:30 am</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">The latest development in our college: we will soon be harnessing solar power.

When I found out my board examination marks were not adequate for computer science, I had been terribly disappointed. It meant that I would have to study in Scottish Church college, or RKMRC (yes, initially, my hopes weren&#8217;t so high, especially because I would be living in a hostel for the first time).</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">After having spent 6 months in RKMRC, I thank God from the core of my heart that He directed me towards this college.
