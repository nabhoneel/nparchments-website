We started off during the hot daytime. We picked up my mother, and then my father drove on continuously for three hours, and arrived at Shantiniketan! After seven months, I truly had a fresh feeling to be there. <!--more-->We shared the bags we had brought and walked through the red soil, towards our house. The area in front of our house is quite large. This time, it was even better: the grasses had been trimmed and small plants of three colours had been planted-purple, fresh green, and dark green. It looked amazing! Even in the diffused rays of the sun, the door glowed with its new golden colour. My father&#8217;s friend&#8217;s family arrived at 11:00 PM, and the eight of us had  <em>chicken bharta </em>and <em>rotis.</em></p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align:justify;\">The 27<sup>th</sup> of March &#8211; বসন্ত উতসব (<em>Basanta Utsav)</em></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">It was the day of <em><a href=\"#holimeaning\">Holi</a> throughout India, </em>and Basanta Utsav is celebrated in Shantiniketan.<br />\nIn terms of &#8216;Holi&#8217;, <em>abirs </em>are primarily used in Shantiniketan.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_371\" style=\"width: 660px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://nabhoneelparchments.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/img_0007.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-371 size-large\" src=\"https://nabhoneelparchments.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/img_0007.jpg?w=660\" alt=\"'Abir' packets on sale\" width=\"660\" height=\"372\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">&#8216;Abir&#8217; packets on sale</figcaption></figure>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">The <em>Basanta Utsav </em>is something slightly different.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">In the central part of Shantiniketan, the university (<em>Biswabharati)</em> students start a musical event by singing and dancing through a fixed route in yellow traditional dresses. This marks the start of the cultural event. After one hour, the main programme starts onstage, with various students, present on that day as <strong>artists</strong>, displaying their talents through songs, dances, plays, and many more. At 9:00 AM, the function ends, and the audience throws <em>abir</em> into the air.
