I have been quite about 3 weeks or so. Well, that&#8217;s because my half-yearly examinations were going on, and I didn&#8217;t want to blog then, as blogging usually fills my head with loads and loads of new ideas to write about. Anyway, that&#8217;s the past. The exams were okay. Chemistry was horrible. Others went okay, not really good, or good&#8230; ðŸ˜›</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Now about my present situation. <!--more-->First of all, I have progressed a bit with my new password storage app in Java.

Only the design is more or less ready.</div>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear:both;text-align:justify;\"></div>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear:both;text-align:justify;\">I have also recorded the 50th anniversary music collection on the synthesizer. It just needs to be converted to a digital format, so that I can include it in my presentation. I will go to my father&#8217;s friend&#8217;s studio and it will easily be done there. I tried doing a lot of times at home. I didn&#8217;t get the right software, and the professional software that I found is about 3.6 GB. So there&#8217;s no question of getting that ðŸ˜¦</div>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear:both;text-align:justify;\"></div>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear:both;text-align:justify;\">My brother in America got a new iMac. But, honestly I feel sorry for him. He took quite a number of games to play at home, but ended up getting a Mac. Now, most of our games are created solely for Windows, or a separate version is created for the Mac OS, which I don&#8217;t have. Now he can&#8217;t get the advantage of having 2 GB of graphics card! I wish he got an Alienware from Dell. Now, that would be useful to him.</div>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear:both;text-align:justify;\"></div>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear:both;text-align:justify;\">I have finished playing Call of Duty Black Ops. And, now I found out from a special website that checks the compatibility of a computer for playing a certain game, that my laptop is does not support any of the games that I have played till now!!! Black Ops requires 256 MB of dedicated graphics&#8230;I have only 64 MB (1696 MB total)! But, the game ran fine on my laptop! It&#8217;s really quite strange.</div>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear:both;text-align:justify;\"></div>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear:both;text-align:justify;\">I was also reading Steve Jobs&#8217; biography lately. That&#8217;s one of the best books I have read! It basically shows the reader how the whole GUI concept came up! How bit-mapping system helped to create special fonts, and circles, and rounded rectangles, and many more!!! And, how the PC came up! It&#8217;s really thrilling to read the evolution of computers.</div>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear:both;text-align:justify;\"></div>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear:both;text-align:justify;\">That&#8217;s all for now. In my next blog, I have planned to tell you about my experience in Mandarmoni. A really special experience (after staying so close to the sea)&#8230;</div>\n</div>\n","date":"2012-09-07T20:04:00.000Z","slug":"lots-to-say","excerpt":"<p>Ah!
