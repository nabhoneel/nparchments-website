We, like many others, find immense joy in the mountains. And the zig-zag roads never fail to captivate us. Gradually, we gained height.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">At the time mentioned in the heading [2:30 PM], we arrived at a small roadside inn and decided to stop there for lunch, since we desperately needed to stretch our legs for some time and additionally, we were famished.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The inn was a part of a small town area, and there was a school nearby.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_1004\" style=\"width: 660px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-1004\" src=\"https://nabhoneelparchments.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/dhanolti-4-of-15.jpg?w=660\" alt=\"Students walking home\" width=\"660\" height=\"661\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Students walking home</figcaption></figure>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The view from the small <em>veranda</em>Â was beautiful!

We had reserved two rooms in the GMVN tourist lodge &#8211; Hotel Dhanaulti Heights. The rooms were large, but service wasn&#8217;t appreciable. However, the location wasÂ impeccable!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Dhanaulti is a small town located 25 km from Mussoorie. The temperatures are mild, and the climate is enjoyable, especially at the time we had visited in.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">One of the main attractions of the place is the Eco Park. Wikipedia states:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There are two Eco-parks, &#8220;Amber&#8221; and &#8220;Dhara&#8221; about 200 m apart. It has been developed recently by the Forest Department of Uttarakhand with the help of local youth.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Our hotel was located adjacent to theÂ <em>AmberÂ </em>park. We could see the small playground from the corridors. I placed my rucksack in our room, and ran off to the park. Again, Gunja followed ðŸ˜›</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_1021\" style=\"width: 660px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-1021 size-large\" src=\"https://nabhoneelparchments.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/1-img_0020-4.jpg?w=660\" alt=\"1-IMG_0020 (4)\" width=\"660\" height=\"555\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">The entrance to Eco Park [taken by my mother]</figcaption></figure><figure id=\"attachment_1014\" style=\"width: 660px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-1014\" src=\"https://nabhoneelparchments.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/1403949181-5.jpg?w=660\" alt=\"This is what you see from the park [Photography obtained from 365 Hops]\" width=\"660\" height=\"440\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">This is what you see from the park [Photography obtained from <a title=\"365 Hops\" href=\"http://www.365hops.com\" target=\"_blank\">365 Hops</a>]</figcaption></figure><figure id=\"attachment_1022\" style=\"width: 660px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-1022\" src=\"https://nabhoneelparchments.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/2-img_0025-5.jpg?w=660\" alt=\"The playground [taken by my mother]\" width=\"660\" height=\"663\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">The playground [taken by my mother]</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I ascended the &#8216;stairs&#8217; when the others arrived.
