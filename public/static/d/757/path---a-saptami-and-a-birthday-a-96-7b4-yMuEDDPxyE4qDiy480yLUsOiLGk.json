This is an unusual post, but my birthday was unexpectedly nice this year, and I received an amazing gift.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">I should be starting off from what happened after 12:00 AM on the 20th of October, but then I&#8217;d be missing out on a couple of things. So, I&#8217;ll start from 6:30 PM, on the day before.<!--more--></p>\n<hr />\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Three of us were returning from our school&#8217;s reunion party, and walking towards City Centre. I was carrying my camera. From City Centre, we parted. I went to a departmental store to join my mother and Gunja (sister). My mother, on seeing me, pulled out an Amazon.com package from her handbag, inquiring, &#8220;What is inside this?&#8221; Honestly, I had no idea. It was addressed to my father.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Then it struck me. I ripped open the seal, desperately. There was a small, flat, white box inside. Inside the box, it was there. The item which was supposed to be delivered after the 14th of November was then in my hands!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">I exited the store and took out the MIR-1B Zenith lens that I always carried around in my camera bag. The adapter screwed onto it perfectly! Following this, it was very easy to attach the lens onto theÂ lens mount of the camera body.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">I, from that moment onwards, have become a proud owner of a 37mm f2.8 prime lens (that was onceÂ used by my mother)!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">These were the first <em>(</em><em>very unexpected) </em>twoÂ birthday gifts that I received from my parents &#8211; an adapter ring, directly imported from China,Â and the (Russian) prime lens.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1408\" src=\"https://nabhoneelparchments.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/img_20151019_194104.jpg?w=660\" alt=\"IMG_20151019_194104\" width=\"660\" height=\"661\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><strong> Fact:Â </strong>It&#8217;s 25 years old. My grandfather gifted it to my mother in 1990.<img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1409\" src=\"https://nabhoneelparchments.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/new-lens.jpg?w=660\" alt=\"new lens\" width=\"660\" height=\"661\" /></p>\n<hr />\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">The first birthday-wishing-call came in at 11:59 PM, on the 19th. Then it was my parents and Gunja. Coupled with their wishes were some other thoughtful (andÂ <em>veryÂ </em>useful) gifts ðŸ™‚</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">The next one came at 4:30 AM.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">[I woke up on hearing the phone ring, and put on my normal voice to answer the phone ðŸ˜€ ]</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">The coming morning was predictable: a wonderful breakfast arranged by my mother.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1414\" src=\"https://nabhoneelparchments.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/breakfast-1-of-1.jpg?w=660\" alt=\"Breakfast (1 of 1)\" width=\"660\" height=\"340\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Following that, I opened my laptop and copied photos from the previous day&#8217;s reunion party.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Then I picked up my camera again. It wasÂ <em>reallyÂ </em>exciting operating a vintage lens. Sreyan had told me about the adapter being available online. Thank you for that.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">[I had searched an entire street of stores having photography equipment, but only one of them asked me to contact them in case they could get their hands on such an adapter. Other photography stores including the popular <em>MM Photographic Store</em>, simply laughed a little, and stated that such adapters are not manufactured, and the lens was useless. Even the store that had asked me to contact them failed to procure one and informed me that such adapters were not available.]</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_1416\" style=\"width: 660px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-1416 size-large\" src=\"https://nabhoneelparchments.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/new-lens-2-of-2.jpg?w=660\" alt=\"New lens (2 of 2)\" width=\"660\" height=\"281\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Now I&#8217;m a proud owner of these two brands ðŸ˜€</figcaption></figure>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1415\" src=\"https://nabhoneelparchments.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/new-lens-1-of-2.jpg?w=660\" alt=\"New lens (1 of 2)\" width=\"660\" height=\"660\" /></p>\n<hr />\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">The evening was unexpected. I wasn&#8217;t so interested to go out on that day, but Rakshit is a guy who gets things done and convinced me. I met him and AdrejaÂ at 4:45 PM, and we walked to City Centre.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_1423\" style=\"width: 660px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-1423 size-large\" src=\"https://nabhoneelparchments.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/saptami-8-of-23-e1445761775473.jpg?w=660\" alt=\"Saptami (8 of 23)\" width=\"660\" height=\"660\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Rakshit and bokeh ðŸ˜€ [and a lot of noise ðŸ˜› ]</figcaption></figure>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Rakshit gifted me a book from Starmark.</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_1418\" style=\"width: 660px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-1418\" src=\"https://nabhoneelparchments.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/nabami-1-of-28-e1445758387132.jpg?w=660\" alt=\"One Hundred Years of Solitude\" width=\"660\" height=\"229\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">One Hundred Years of Solitude</figcaption></figure><br />\nWe later met Rohit and Susmita.<br />\nThe fun started at FD Park, in the rides&#8217; area.

For some reason, I had not wanted a cake this year, but an uncle brought one as a gift while I was out in the evening. We cut the cake and conversed and had delectable roast chicken prepared by my mother (again).<br />\nI love spending my birthdays each year. However, this year it was unpredictably nice. Not just the prime lens. The phone calls throughout the day (and the one on the day before), the evening, and it did not even end then.<br />\nAfter dropping off Sourabh, I went to Sreyan&#8217;sÂ and spent some time testing the lens ðŸ˜€<br />\n<figure id=\"attachment_1433\" style=\"width: 660px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-1433\" src=\"https://nabhoneelparchments.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/saptami-16-of-23-e1445765493184.jpg?w=660\" alt=\"He somehow obeyed Sreyan and stood still for him, in front of him!\" width=\"660\" height=\"660\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">He somehow obeyed Sreyan and stood still for him, in front of him!
