The following day, we were to reach college by 11 AM.</p>\n<hr />\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">At 11:00 AM, we reached the conference hall on the second floor of our college. Our quiz masters were making everything ready. At 11:15 AM, each team was handed out a booklet containing 25 multiple choice questions. These questions were mainly focused on algorithmic complexity and mathematics.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">After 25 minutes, the booklets were analyzed, and six teams were chosen. The six teams were assigned letters &#8211; A, B, C, D, E and F, and asked to sit in the first two rows of the conference room. The first round of the quiz commenced at 12:00 PM.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_1087\" style=\"width: 660px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-1087\" src=\"https://nabhoneelparchments.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/conference_room.jpg?w=660\" alt=\"The Conference Room\" width=\"660\" height=\"274\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Conference Room</figcaption></figure>\n<hr />\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">A few rules were common for each round. <em>The audience </em>(the quizzers who were not selected in the selection round) <em>could participate</em> and they would receive a small token for correct answers. <em>After each round, one team would be &#8216;knocked out&#8217;.</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">The quiz masters would be displaying the questions on a white screen with the help of a projector connected to a laptop.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_1090\" style=\"width: 660px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-1090 size-large\" src=\"https://nabhoneelparchments.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/quiz_masters.jpg?w=660\" alt=\"Our quiz masters - Arka da, Snehashish da, Attyuttam da, Pratik da [from left to right]\" width=\"660\" height=\"440\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Our quiz masters &#8211; Arka da, Snehashish da, Attyuttam da, Pratik da [from left to right]</figcaption></figure>\n<hr />\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">The rules of theÂ <strong>first round</strong> were simple enough.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">A team gets asked a question. If they answer correctly, they get 30Â points, otherwise the question passes on to the other teams, sequentially. The audience could answer if all the teams failed to answer.</p>\n<hr />\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">The <strong>second round</strong> required careful planning. <em>Each team could choose to (or, not to) bet 5 &#8211; 15 points</em> for a certain question (before it was presented to the quizzers). Suppose team A is about to receive their directÂ question. The other teams may place bets. If team A gives the right answer, they&#8217;ll obtain 20 points, otherwise, no points will be deducted. Among the other teams, those who have placed bets,Â will<strong>Â </strong>have to answer. If they answer correctly, they&#8217;ll obtain points equal to double their bet amount. Otherwise, they lose points equal to the amount of bet they had placed.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">There were two consecutive rounds that had the option of betting. They lasted for almost two hours!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">The questions were primarily based on pattern detection (and guessing the next element in the pattern), complexity calculation, encrypting and decrypting messages. The questions wereÂ <em>very interesting,Â </em>and, they weren&#8217;t so easy either. In fact, the answer to a certain question (about family relations) was debated on for almost 15 &#8211; 20 minutes (due to ambiguous answers)!</p>\n<hr />\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Everyone was famished after three and a half hours of <em>Loop.Â </em>Chicken rolls were served to all those present inside the hall. I won&#8217;t lie. We had a good time eating those ðŸ˜€ Later, tea was available.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_1084\" style=\"width: 450px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-1084 size-medium\" src=\"https://nabhoneelparchments.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/refreshments.jpg?w=450\" alt=\"Refreshments (Tea)\" width=\"450\" height=\"450\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Tea being served | Photograph: Arpan Roy</figcaption></figure>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Half an hour later, the debugging round initiated. The three teams were given two programs, and they would have to detect all sorts of errors &#8211; logical and syntactical. One of the quiz-masters, Pratik Roy, projected the codes on the big screen as well, for the audience to solve.</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_1086\" style=\"width: 660px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-1086 size-large\" src=\"https://nabhoneelparchments.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/winners.jpg?w=660\" alt=\"winners\" width=\"660\" height=\"440\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">The debugging round | Photograph: Arpan Roy</figcaption></figure><br />\n<figure id=\"attachment_1085\" style=\"width: 660px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-1085 size-large\" src=\"https://nabhoneelparchments.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/runnerup.jpg?w=660\" alt=\"runnerup\" width=\"660\" height=\"321\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Final checking | Photograph: Arpan Roy</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">This was the round which decided which teams would compete for the first and second positions. Surprisingly, the two teams which went forward in the quiz comprised of students from the first year only.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_1092\" style=\"width: 660px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-1092\" src=\"https://nabhoneelparchments.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/medals1.jpg?w=660\" alt=\"The prizes were arranged soon after this round\" width=\"660\" height=\"426\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">The prizes were arranged after this round | Photograph: Arpan Roy</figcaption></figure>\n<hr />\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">The final round was theÂ <strong>buzzer round</strong>. Due to the lack of a proper buzzing system, the competitors were asked to stand up if they had the correct answer. The team member standing up first would represent his team and answer. There were no negative scores. The answering team would be awarded 30 points. If that team failed, the question would pass on to the other team, and finally to the audience.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Tough questions on algorithm complexity were displayed on the big screen.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Only one team was able to answer one question, however, the other team was much ahead of them, in terms of points, owing to their performance in the previous rounds.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">They were almost 20 points ahead! They &#8211; Ayan and Rijul &#8211; were the winners ofÂ <em>Loop!</em></p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_1095\" style=\"width: 660px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-1095\" src=\"https://nabhoneelparchments.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/first.jpg?w=660\" alt=\"The winners - Ayan Ghoshal &amp; Rijul Neogi [right-most] receiving prizes from our teachers\" width=\"660\" height=\"526\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">The winners &#8211; Ayan Ghoshal &amp; Rijul Neogi [right-most] receiving prizes from our teachers | Photograph: Arpan Roy</figcaption></figure><figure id=\"attachment_1093\" style=\"width: 660px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-1093\" src=\"https://nabhoneelparchments.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/runnersup.jpg?w=660\" alt=\"Our teachers handing out prizes to the runner-up team - Shirshak &amp; Abhinandan [right-most]\" width=\"660\" height=\"659\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Our teachers handing out prizes to the runner-up team &#8211; Shirshak &amp; Abhinandan [right-most] | Photograph: Arpan Roy</figcaption></figure></p>\n<hr />\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">This was the first time the department of computer science organized a quiz, and it was possible only through the efforts of our seniors, who used whatever resources they had in hand, and created a well planned, innovative, and aÂ <strong>veryÂ </strong>interesting quiz session that didn&#8217;t get tiresome even though it lasted for five hours!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Each of the quiz masters handled the wholeÂ eventÂ <em>very efficiently,Â </em>and Attyuttam Saha, especially, presented and coordinated each round ofÂ <em>LoopÂ </em>very smoothly.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">We later came to know that the four of them had solved the questions themselves before presenting them to us.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Apart from the quality of the questions, and the whole session (in general), there was also another distinctive feature. During each question, the person providing the answer would have to provide the logic as well. There was no scope of making a lucky guess and scoring points.</p>\n<hr />\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;font-size:20px;\">2015&#8217;sÂ <em>LoopÂ </em>was a <i>&#8216;demo&#8217;Â </i>run.
