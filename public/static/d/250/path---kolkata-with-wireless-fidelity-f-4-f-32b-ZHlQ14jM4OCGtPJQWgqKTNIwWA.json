The need for internet has been escalating in the last few years. Kolkata needed WiFi. And it was served what it needed.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><!--more--></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;text-align:justify;\">The 5<sup>th</sup> of February, 2015 was historic.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">I got the chance to be present at the formal launch of the free 4G WiFi provided by Reliance Jio, at Park Street, as a part of Kolkata Bloggers.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_753\" style=\"width: 585px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-753\" src=\"https://nabhoneelparchments.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/start.png\" alt=\"The stage being set\" width=\"585\" height=\"435\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">The stage being set</figcaption></figure>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Having arrived late, I was unable to get a certain privilege 10 bloggers of the <a href=\"http://www.kolkatabloggers.com/\">Kolkata Bloggers</a> team obtained &#8211; WiFi access an hour and a half before the connection was made &#8216;open&#8217; for the public!</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_751\" style=\"width: 580px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-751\" src=\"https://nabhoneelparchments.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/audience_start.png\" alt=\"The audience eagerly waiting for the launch\" width=\"580\" height=\"433\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">The audience eagerly waiting for the launch</figcaption></figure>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">The event was inaugurated by the mayor &#8211; Shovan Chatterjee.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_754\" style=\"width: 588px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-754\" src=\"https://nabhoneelparchments.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/shovan.png\" alt=\"Shovan Chatterjee\" width=\"588\" height=\"437\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Shovan Chatterjee</figcaption></figure>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Following him, Subrata Mukherjee spoke on the upcoming digital age Kolkata would be entering into.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_755\" style=\"width: 589px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-755\" src=\"https://nabhoneelparchments.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/subrata.png\" alt=\"Subrata \" width=\"589\" height=\"437\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Subrata Mukherjee</figcaption></figure>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Mr. Tarun Jhunjhunwala (from Reliance) then spoke about the 4G technology that would encompass the city.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_756\" style=\"width: 562px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-756\" src=\"https://nabhoneelparchments.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/jhunjhun.png\" alt=\"Tarun Jhunjhunwala\" width=\"562\" height=\"414\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Tarun Jhunjhunwala</figcaption></figure>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">At this point, let me tell you about the WiFi connection. A misconception has spread that only 4G enabled devices will be able to access this connection. Reliance Jio is equipping the citizens of Kolkata an internet connection that will supply 4G internet speed, but through WiFi, purely. This means that <strong>any </strong>device, that can harness WiFi, can use this connection.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_757\" style=\"width: 587px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-757\" src=\"https://nabhoneelparchments.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/night_stage1.png\" alt=\"The night stage!\" width=\"587\" height=\"433\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">The night stage!</figcaption></figure>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Following Mr Jhunjhunwala, the honourable Chief Minister of West Bengal &#8211; Mamata Banerjee &#8211; took the microphone to thank Reliance for their support.This had been a &#8216;secret&#8217; project. During the past two years, optical fibers were laid down throughout the city, and WiFi hotspots were set up in various places in Kolkata. This was possible primarily due to the efforts of Reliance &#8211; and the workers who were employed to do the task.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_760\" style=\"width: 660px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-large wp-image-760\" src=\"https://nabhoneelparchments.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/mamataspeaking.jpg?w=660\" alt=\"Mamata Banerjee speaking\" width=\"660\" height=\"248\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Mamata Banerjee</figcaption></figure>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">The chief minister then connected to the WiFi network, and posted the first Twitter update with #WiFiKolkata:</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_758\" style=\"width: 585px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-758 size-full\" src=\"https://nabhoneelparchments.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/tweet.png\" alt=\"The Chief Minister's first tweet using the WiFi connection by Reliance\" width=\"585\" height=\"378\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Chief Minister&#8217;s first tweets using the WiFi connection by Reliance</figcaption></figure>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">A <strong>huge </strong>round of applause followed when the tweet was made visible on the giant screen!</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_759\" style=\"width: 660px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-759 size-large\" src=\"https://nabhoneelparchments.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/tweetposted.jpg?w=660\" alt=\"When the tweets were posted\" width=\"660\" height=\"248\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">When the tweets were posted</figcaption></figure>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">The audience was notified that the WiFi would be made available for the public at 6:00 PM.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Reliance Jio demonstrated the WiFi speeds on the giant screen.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_761\" style=\"width: 534px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-761\" src=\"https://nabhoneelparchments.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/speedmeasure.png\" alt=\"Speed test by Ookla\" width=\"534\" height=\"383\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Speed test by Ookla</figcaption></figure>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Kolkata&#8217;s favourite singer/songwriter Anupam Roy took up his guitar and sang two immensely popular songs written by him.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_785\" style=\"width: 467px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-785 size-large\" src=\"https://nabhoneelparchments.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/img_1131.jpg?w=467\" alt=\"img_1131\" width=\"467\" height=\"700\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Anupam Roy [Photograph by <a href=\"https://asmitanandy.wordpress.com/\">Asmita Nandy</a>]</figcaption></figure>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">The crowd was delighted!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Dr. Amit Mitra ended the event with a note of thanks.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_772\" style=\"width: 590px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-772\" src=\"https://nabhoneelparchments.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/mitra.jpg?w=660\" alt=\"Dr. Sanjay Mitra\" width=\"590\" height=\"590\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Dr. Amit Mitra</figcaption></figure>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:'Courier New';\">If you wish to skip over to the instructions to connect to the WiFi network, click <a href=\"#instructions\">here</a>.</span></p>\n<hr />\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">This was clearly a milestone in the history of Kolkata. <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sahaanirbannew\" target=\"_blank\">Anirban Saha</a>, the lead of <a href=\"http://www.kolkatabloggers.com\" target=\"_blank\">Kolkata Bloggers</a> had posted a question on his Facebook Timeline</p>\n<blockquote><p>What is your take on Wi-Fi enabled Kolkata?</p></blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">While some were feeling extremely positive about the advent of WiFi throughout the city&#8230;</p>\n<blockquote><p>Its a big step towards digital literacy. People till now who were not sure if they should have mobile data will now enjoy and taste the free service and finally join the digital world. So its a step towards digital literacy for the mass.<br />\n&#8211; Supratik Chatterjee</p></blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">&#8230;certain people pointed out some different, valid points. I believe two are extremely important.</p>\n<ol style=\"text-align:justify;\">\n<li style=\"padding-left:30px;\">The city doesn&#8217;t really &#8216;need&#8217; WiFi enabled sections as much as it needs a proper drainage system during the rainy season. Calcutta lacks in the fundamental needs of a proper metropolitan, and those requirements should be fulfilled first. Making the city WiFi enabled can be added as the final strokes to a Masterpiece.<br />\n&#8211; Amitendu Maity</li>\n<li style=\"padding-left:30px;\">How efficiently will this work? Currently, the load isn&#8217;t that much, and frankly, handling a single area in Kolkata &#8211; the Park Street region &#8211; is much easier compared to the mayor&#8217;s goal of providing WiFi to Salt Lake, Rajarhat, Barasat &#8211; covering the entire city! How will it hold up in the future?</li>\n</ol>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Apart from these two factors, the question of the day was</p>\n<blockquote><p>How&#8217;s the internet speed?</p></blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">No one can answer this question. As more and more users connect, we&#8217;ll get to see the outcome. From that day, and from the little we used, it was fine. I&#8217;m including this snippet from <a href=\"http://www.anirbansaha.com/wi-fi-and-kolkata-the-city-of-the-future/\" target=\"_blank\">Anirban Saha&#8217;s Blog</a> to give you a better idea:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">The major skepticism about this Wi-Fi are about the speed it will offer and how free it shall be after a few months. The little that we have used &#8211; seemed fine. Rajya Sabha MP Derek O&#8217;Brien, informed more than 230 routing machines were installed in Park Street itself, each capable of handling 40 machines. That&#8217;s precisely 9200 machines in Park Street alone can access the WiFi without the speed drooping down. While Reliance is keeping tight lipped, insiders in the ruling political party informed me &#8211; freemium model is what is desired. Since this is a cost proposition, Reliance might charge money but not any time soon (might be after Durga Pujas).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Let&#8217;s hope this works out well. The entire generation of <em>netizens </em>is hoping this 🙂</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_766\" style=\"width: 660px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-766\" src=\"https://nabhoneelparchments.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/groupfie.jpg\" alt=\"The Kolkata Bloggers team with Derek O'Brien\" width=\"660\" height=\"371\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Kolkata Bloggers team with Derek O&#8217;Brien [from <a href=\"http://souravghosh.com/\">Sourav Ghosh</a>]</figcaption></figure>\n<hr />\n<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">The WiFi is currently limited to Park Street.
